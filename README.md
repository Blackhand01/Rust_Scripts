# Rust Scripts

Welcome to my Rust Scripts repository! This is a collection of exercises I've completed to practice and deepen my understanding of Rust. Each exercise is contained within its own folder, with a brief description provided below.

## Battleship

In the `battleship` directory, I implemented a program that simulates the creation and management of a 20x20 Battleship game board. The board is stored in a file, and the program allows for the safe addition of ships, ensuring they do not overlap or touch each other. I focused on handling file manipulation and command-line interface parsing using the `clap` crate.

## DNA Sequence Matcher

The `DNA_sequence` folder contains my exploration of searching for specific DNA subsequences within larger DNA strings. I worked on implementing various search strategies, including the use of lambda functions, simple iterators, and Rust-compliant iterators. This exercise helped me gain a deeper understanding of Rust's lifetime annotations and iterator patterns.

## File System Simulator

In the `file_system` directory, I developed an in-memory file system that supports operations like creating, removing, and updating files and directories. The focus was on implementing a tree structure to manage the file system's hierarchy and ensuring that all operations adhered to Rust's strict ownership and borrowing rules. This exercise was particularly valuable for understanding how to work with mutable references and lifetime annotations in complex data structures.

Each exercise represents a step forward in my journey to mastering Rust, tackling real-world problems with a focus on safety, performance, and concurrency.
